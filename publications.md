## Research Papers

The Effekt language is developed by members of the [effects research team at the
University of Tübingen](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/research/effects/).

The language is the result of several developments. In particular, it is the
first language to combine a second-class type-system with control effects.
In particular, we compile Effekt programs to capability-passing style, using
a monadic impementation of delimited control.

You can read more about the language, its predecessors, and important
technical details in the following papers, which are ordered by relevance
to the Effekt language. We are happy to share author-copies on request.
