Currently, the Effekt language is implemented in Scala and compiles to JavaScript.
To use the Effekt compiler and run the resulting programs, you need to have

- Java (>= 1.8),
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 10), and
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

installed.

The recommended way to install Effekt is by running:
```
npm install -g https://github.com/effekt-lang/effekt/releases/latest/download/effekt.tgz
```
This will download the compiler and install the `effekt` command in your path.

Alternatively, you can also download a specific release on the
[release page on Github](https://github.com/effekt-lang/effekt/releases).

And then install it with
```
npm install -g <PATH_TO_FILE>/effekt.tgz
```
