      "Effect Handlers",
      "(Algebraic) effect handlers let you define advanced control-flow structures like Generators as user libraries. Those libraries can be seamlessly composed.",
      "#intro-handlers"]

  - second: [
      "Effect Safety",
      "A type- and effect system that does not get into your way. Rely on a simple, yet powerful effect system that guarantees all effects to be handled.",
      "#intro-safety"]

  - third: [
      "Lightweight Effect Polymorphism",
      "No need to understand effect polymorphic functions or annotate them. Explicit effect polymorphism simply does not exist.",

## Getting Started
If you are interested in the Effekt language, there are a few things you can do to get started:

1. To get a first impression of the distinguishing features, read the quick-guides on this page ([effect handlers](#intro-handlers), [effect safety](#intro-safety), [effect polymorphism](#intro-polymorphism)).
2. To play around with the language, you can use the [online editor](quickstart).
3. To install Effekt and try the examples on your own computer you can follow the [installation instructions](docs/getting-started).
4. To understand the theory and concepts behind Effekt, you can read about [design considerations](design-considerations), or read the [academic papers](publications).
