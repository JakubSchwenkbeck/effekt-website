## Getting Started
Currently, the Effekt language is implemented in Scala and compiles to JavaScript.
To use the Effekt compiler and run the resulting programs, you need to have a
Java (>= 1.8), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 10)
and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed.

The recommended way to install Effekt is by running:
```
npm install -g https://github.com/effekt-lang/effekt/releases/latest/download/effekt.tgz
```
This will download the compiler and install the `effekt` command.

Alternatively, you can also download a specific release on the
[release page on Github](https://github.com/effekt-lang/effekt/releases).

And then install it with
```
npm install -g <PATH_TO_FILE>/effekt.tgz
```

### Running the REPL

After making sure you satisfy all requirements and installed Effekt, you
can run the Effekt REPL by entering the following command:
```
effekt
```
Running Effekt without any additional arguments will bring you into the REPL:
```
  _____     ______  __  __     _    _
 (_____)   |  ____|/ _|/ _|   | |  | |
   ___     | |__  | |_| |_ ___| | _| |_
  (___)    |  __| |  _|  _/ _ \ |/ / __|
  _____    | |____| | | ||  __/   <| |_
 (_____)   |______|_| |_| \___|_|\_\\__|

 Welcome to the Effekt interpreter. Enter a top-level definition, or
 an expression to evaluate.

 To print the available commands, enter :help

>
```
Here, you can define functions, import modules and enter expressions to evaluate.
Executing commands in the REPL compiles the corresponding Effekt-programs
to Javascript (you can find them in `./out/`) and runs them with Node.js.

You can find example programs in the [examples folder](https://github.com/effekt-lang/effekt/tree/master/examples/pos).
